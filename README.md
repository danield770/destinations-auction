# Assignment Notes

1) The app is responsive, so be sure to resize to various widths

2) The app is easily themable by simply altering the hue custom property in the developer tools (see screen shot)

   Of course, in a real app, there would be the appropriate UI for the user to choose the theme

3) Regarding lazy loading of the images: 

I have added the loading='lazy' native property (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-loading)) which has pretty good browser support (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr))

If I had more time, I could add support for older browsers by initally adding a data-src attribute to the images instead of a src attribute. 
 - An intersection Observer is attached to all the images to be lazy loaded.
 - Once the Intersection Observer API detects that the element has entered the viewport, using the isIntersecting property, move the data-src attribute to the src attribute for the browser to trigger the image load.
 - Once this is done, remove the observer from that image.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
